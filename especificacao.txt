Instructions for the Shell Project

What to do

Write a shell with the following functionality

Execution of build-in commands (at least: exit, help, jobs, fg, bg,; but you will find interesting to implement also 'cd', 'pwd' etc.)
Execution of external commands via exec syscall (in foreground and background)
Redirection of input and output (<, >, >>)
Pipes (unlimited sequential pipes, p.ex. cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3....)
Job control (suspend jobs, put in background, foreground etc.)

Provide a Makefile

Rules
Use exclusively the libc, and nothing else,
o, not even readline lib; if you want to implement history functionality (congratulations), make it yourself.
yes, you can use POSIX semaphores
Use gcc as the compiler
Of course, the shell must be for linux

Notes
Your software must compiple with gcc -Wall and withotut -D_GNU_SOURCE
Your software must compile and run without warnings or errors
Tips
Check all your system calls: ex. pid = fork(); if (pid<0)...
